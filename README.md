## Who am I?

Full-stack developer and Computer Engineering student at Istanbul Commerce University, building things since 2018. I work across the stack — from training neural networks to shipping games, from cloud infrastructure to hardware prototypes. My approach: understand the problem deeply, then build something that actually works.

I'm drawn to projects where software meets the physical world. Signal processing, embedded systems, brain-computer interfaces — the messy problems where clean abstractions break down.

### NEST

**Neural EEG Sequence Transducer**

A research framework for decoding raw EEG signals into natural language.
It currently doesn't work, but soon there will be English text generation from brain activity.
